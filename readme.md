# Laravel Lux
Lux is a versatile package inspired by <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shadcn</a>, designed to seamlessly integrate with Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Livewire, and Laravel. It provides a robust set of tools and components that streamline the development process, making it easier to build dynamic and responsive web applications. While Lux offers built-in support for Livewire to enhance interactivity, its use is entirely optional, allowing developers the flexibility to choose the best tools for their specific needs.

Whether you're building a simple website or a complex web application, Lux aims to simplify your workflow and enhance your productivity.
